📘 Project Summary

This project analyzes the 2024 E-commerce Sales dataset using a complete Python-based ETL pipeline built with Pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter Notebook. The merged dataset enabled insights into category conversion rates, payment method behavior, and monthly purchasing trends through visualizations created with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. A Random Forest predictive model (Scikit-learn) was developed to explore purchase likelihood and customer behavior patterns. The entire workflow was managed using Git, GitHub, and Agile Kanban boards, ensuring clear tracking, documentation, and iterative development.

🎯 Objectives
•	Extract, clean, and merge multiple E-commerce datasets (Sales, Customers, Products)
•	Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover behavioral insights
•	Visualize key trends using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
•	Build a predictive model to estimate purchase probability
•	Apply Agile methodology for planning and documentation
•	Present findings through reports and presentations

🔄 ETL Pipeline Summary
Extract:
- Loaded three CSV files from Kaggle: sales_data.csv, customer_data.csv, and product_data.csv
Transform:
- Cleaned missing values and duplicates
- Standardized timestamps and categorical data
- Merged datasets on unique keys (user id and product id)
- Created new features (e.g., is_purchase, Month)
Load:
- Exported cleaned dataset to merged_ecommerce_data.csv
Validation:
- Checked data integrity (shapes, missing values, and logical consistency)

📊 Data Analysis & Visualization
Key Insights:
•	Age 25–40 customers make the most purchases.

•	Digital payments (PayPal, Credit Card) dominate successful transactions.

•	Top 10 products generate 60% of total sales.

•	Sales spike during Q4 (October–December).

2.	Customer Gender Distribution Pie Chart:(images/pie_chart.png)

3.	Monthly Purchase Trend Line Chart:(images/monthly_purchase_trend.png)

4.	Feature Importance Bar Chart:(images/feature_importance.png)
📍 Visuals generated in Jupyter Notebook using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
👉 Visualizations included in report and notebook.

🤖 Predictive Modeling
Goal: Predict whether a user will make a purchase based on demographics and behavior.
Model Used: Random Forest Classifier
Features: Age, Gender, Payment Method, Frequency of Purchases
Target: is_purchase (1 = purchase, 0 = non-purchase)
Accuracy: ~85% on test data
Feature Importance Ranking: 1. Frequency of Purchases
2. Payment Method
3. Age
4. Gender

## 📊 Business Insights and Visualizations

### 1️⃣ Category Conversion Rate (Purchases / Views)

![Category Conversion Rate](images/category_conversion_rate.png)

**Insight:**
Top categories like **Footwear** and **Outerwear** exhibit the highest conversion rates, indicating strong purchase intent after product views.
**Business Action:** Prioritize promotions and inventory for high-conversion categories.

---

### 2️⃣ Average Order Value (AOV) by Payment Method

![Average Order Value](images/aov_by_payment_method.png)

**Insight:**
**Debit Card** and **Bank Transfer** users record the highest average purchase values ($60–$62).
**Business Action:** Focus marketing and cashback offers on these payment methods to maximize order value.

---

### 3️⃣ Monthly Purchase Trend for Top Categories

![Monthly Trend](images/monthly_trend_top_categories.png)

**Insight:**
Sales peaks appear around **March** and **September**, aligning with promotional periods.
**Business Action:** Plan future marketing campaigns and product launches around these high-activity months.
 
  🎯Customer Insights

Ages 25–40 are the highest purchasing segment

Digital payments → higher conversion

Engagement frequency is the #1 purchase predictor

 🎯Product Insights

Footwear & Outerwear → highest conversion

Accessories → high views, low conversions

Some categories produce disproportionate revenue

💡 Recommendations

Promote high-performing categories via paid ads

Improve Accessories page quality (images, bundles)

Incentivize card/PayPal payments

Plan campaigns for seasonal peaks

Retarget high-frequency users

Build loyalty program for digital wallet users
